#Waste Management System


#Overview
This project aims to address waste management in communities, particularly focusing on involving schools in a certain area. By fostering competition among schools to recycle waste products, we aim to incentivize waste reduction efforts while simultaneously promoting environmental awarenessand responsibility among students. The Waste Management System, developed by our team, facilitates this process by coordinating waste collection, sorting, and recycling activities.

#Key Features
School Competition: Schools in the designated area compete in recycling waste products.

Waste Collection: Trash Attack, our waste collection service, picks up the sorted waste from participating schools.

Sorting and Recycling: Collected waste is sorted and sold to companies in need of recyclable materials,
such as Greentech Technologies, which uses plastics to produce eco-friendly and affordable bricks.

##Incentives for Students:## Top students who collect the most waste receive prizes such as goodie bags, vouchers, and school bags.

Collaboration with Organizations: We collaborate with various organizations to make waste management initiatives engaging and sustainable.

Illegal Dumping Reporting: Community members can report instances of illegal dumping through our platform, 
including geotagging and photo uploads for swift action.

Garbage Collection Timetable: Never miss a waste collection day with personalized timetables and helpful reminders.
